# music_variation_generator
This project generates new music variations using an LSTM model trained on J.S. Bachâ€™s Goldberg Variations. The model predicts pitch, step, and duration of notes to create original sequences. MIDI data is processed, visualized, and output using Python tools. Temperature sampling ensures creative and diverse outputs.
